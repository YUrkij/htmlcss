        <p class="tipe2">
            Two households, both alike in dignity,<br />
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br />
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br />
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br />
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br />
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br />
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br />
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br />
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br />
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br />
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br />
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br />
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br />
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

            No, for then we should be colliers.
